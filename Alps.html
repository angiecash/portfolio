                    <p><em>Crafting an Accessible Alpine Escape: A Two-Page Experience for a Swiss Resort</em></p>
                </div>

                <div id="info">
                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>The project required developing two web pages, a home page and a contact page, each featuring a shared hero image for a fictional resort located in the Swiss Alps. The site needed to feel inviting and easy to navigate for potential travelers seeking an alpine getaway. All the text, images, and colors needed to meet accessibility standards, ensuring the site could be enjoyed by a wide range of users.</p>

                    <p>In addition to building the site, I was responsible for creating a resort name and establishing brand guidelines. The project also required validated, semantic HTML, validated CSS, the use of a single shared style sheet, and the CSS obfuscated prior to publishing.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                    <p>This project reflects the user experience and visual structure often found in modern travel and resort websites. The target audience includes potential travelers researching lodging, activities, and amenities that are seeking a calm, visually immersive experience. The resort name and design elements used allowed for a cohesive identity that communicate elegance and relaxation.</p>

                    <p>The creative inspiration for the site came from exploring the expressive potential of CSS, particularly transitions and effects that could add an elegant, dynamic touch while maintaining accessibility for all visitors.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>Using the provided outline and wireframes, I first built the structural foundation for both required pages. From there, I customized the design by developing the resort name, creating brand elements, writing semantic HTML, selecting a background pattern, and designing a cohesive color scheme that could be carried across the site.</p>

                    <p>After the layout was finalized, I experimented with various CSS transitions and visual effects to determine which enhancements best supported the overall user experience. One of the key challenges was ensuring both pages could rely on a single shared style sheet, which required intentional decisions about reuseable class names, consistent spacing, and flexible layout rules. This approach helped maintain visual cohesion and reduce redundant code.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>The final website fulfilled all outlined requirements and successfully created a visually appealing, accessible experience for users exploring the fictional resort. Both pages were fully validated, featured a consistent hero image, and presented a cohesive aesthetic with a clearly defined brand identity. The CSS was successfully obfuscated before publishing, and all deliverables were completed on time.</p>

                    <p>The final site reflects the project goals: accessible design, semantic structure, cohesive styling, and a visually inviting experience that aligns with modern travel website expectations.</p>
